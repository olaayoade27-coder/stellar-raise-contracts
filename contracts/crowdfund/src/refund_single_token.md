# `refund_single` — Pull-Based Token Refund

## Overview

`refund_single` is the preferred refund mechanism for the crowdfund contract.
It replaces the deprecated batch `refund()` function with a pull-based model
where each contributor independently claims their own refund.

## Why pull-based?

The old `refund()` iterated over every contributor in a single transaction.
On a campaign with many contributors this is unsafe:

- **Unbounded gas**: iteration cost grows linearly with contributor count.
- **Denial of service**: a single bad actor could bloat the contributors list
  to make the batch refund prohibitively expensive.
- **Poor composability**: scripts and automation cannot easily retry partial
  failures.

`refund_single` processes exactly one contributor per call, so gas costs are
constant and predictable regardless of campaign size.

## Function Signature

```rust
pub fn refund_single(env: Env, contributor: Address) -> Result<(), ContractError>
```

### Arguments

| Parameter     | Type      | Description                                      |
|---------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `contributor` | `Address` | The address claiming the refund (must be caller) |

### Return value

`Ok(())` on success, or one of the errors below.

### Errors

| Error                          | Condition                                                    |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ContractError::CampaignStillActive` | Deadline has not yet passed                            |
| `ContractError::GoalReached`   | Campaign goal was met — no refunds available                 |
| `ContractError::NothingToRefund` | Caller has no contribution on record (or already claimed)  |

### Panics

- `"campaign is not active"` — campaign status is `Successful` or `Cancelled`.

## Security Model

1. **Authentication** — `contributor.require_auth()` is called first. Only the
   contributor themselves can trigger their own refund.

2. **Direction Lock** — The token transfer explicitly uses the contract's address
   as the sender and the contributor as the recipient. This prevents parameter-order
   typos and ensures the direction cannot be reversed by a caller.

2. **Direction Lock** — The token transfer explicitly uses the contract's address
   as the sender and the contributor as the recipient. This prevents parameter-order
   typos and ensures the direction cannot be reversed by a caller.

3. **Checks-Effects-Interactions** — The contribution record is zeroed in
   storage *before* the token transfer is executed. This prevents re-entrancy
   and double-claim attacks even if the token contract calls back into the
   crowdfund contract.

4. **Overflow protection** — `total_raised` is decremented with `checked_sub`,
   panicking on underflow rather than silently wrapping.

5. **Status guard** — `Successful` and `Cancelled` campaigns are explicitly
   rejected. A `Refunded` campaign (set by the deprecated batch path) is
   allowed so that any contributor not swept by the batch can still claim.

## Events

On success, the following event is emitted:

```
topic:  ("campaign", "refund_single")
data:   (contributor: Address, amount: i128)
```

Off-chain indexers and scripts should listen for this event to track refund
activity without polling storage.

## Deprecation of `refund()`

The batch `refund()` function is **deprecated** as of contract v3. It remains
callable for backward compatibility but will be removed in a future upgrade.

Migration checklist for scripts and frontends:

- [ ] Remove any call to `refund()`.
- [ ] For each contributor, call `refund_single(contributor)` instead.
- [ ] Handle `NothingToRefund` gracefully (contributor already claimed or
      was never a contributor).
- [ ] Listen for `("campaign", "refund_single")` events instead of
      `("campaign", "refunded")`.

## CLI Usage

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --network testnet \
  --source <CONTRIBUTOR_SECRET_KEY> \
  -- refund_single \
  --contributor <CONTRIBUTOR_ADDRESS>
```

## Script Example (TypeScript / Stellar SDK)

```typescript
import { Contract, SorobanRpc, TransactionBuilder, Networks } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

async function claimRefund(
  contractId: string,
  contributorKeypair: Keypair,
  server: SorobanRpc.Server
) {
  const account = await server.getAccount(contributorKeypair.publicKey());
  const contract = new Contract(contractId);

  const tx = new TransactionBuilder(account, { fee: "100", networkPassphrase: Networks.TESTNET })
    .addOperation(
      contract.call("refund_single", contributorKeypair.publicKey())
    )
    .setTimeout(30)
    .build();

  const prepared = await server.prepareTransaction(tx);
  prepared.sign(contributorKeypair);
  const result = await server.sendTransaction(prepared);
  return result;
}
```

## Storage Layout

|------------------------------|------------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| `DataKey::Contribution(addr)`| Persistent | `i128`  | Per-contributor balance; zeroed on claim |
| `DataKey::TotalRaised`       | Instance   | `i128`  | Global total; decremented on each claim  |

# refund_single_token — Single-Contributor Token Refund Logic

## Overview

This module documents, isolates, and tests the `refund_single` token transfer
pattern used inside the `CrowdfundContract::refund()` and `cancel()` bulk loops.

The core operation is simple: read a contributor's stored balance, transfer it
back from the contract to the contributor, then zero the record to prevent a
double-refund.  By extracting this into a named, documented function the logic
becomes independently testable and auditable.

---

## Why This Module Exists

The original `refund()` function performed the token transfer inline inside a
`for` loop with no inline comments, making it hard to:

- Reason about the storage-mutation ordering (read → transfer → zero)
- Verify double-refund prevention
- Test the single-contributor path in isolation
- Audit the security assumptions around re-entrancy

This module addresses all four points.

## API

### `refund_single(env, token_address, contributor) -> i128`

Transfers the contributor's stored balance back to them and zeroes the record.

| Parameter       | Type        | Description                                      |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `env`           | `&Env`      | Soroban execution environment                    |
| `token_address` | `&Address`  | Token contract address (set at initialisation)   |
| `contributor`   | `&Address`  | The contributor to refund                        |
| **returns**     | `i128`      | Amount refunded (0 if nothing was owed)          |

### `get_contribution(env, contributor) -> i128`

Read-only query of a contributor's stored balance.  Returns 0 if the key is
absent (never contributed or already refunded).

---

## Security Assumptions

1. **Contract holds the tokens** — The contract must hold at least `amount`
   tokens before `refund_single` is called.  This is guaranteed by the
   `contribute()` function which transfers tokens in before recording them.

2. **Storage-before-transfer ordering** — The contribution record is zeroed
   *after* the token transfer succeeds.  If the transfer panics (e.g. the
   token contract rejects it), the entire transaction is rolled back and the
   record remains intact — no funds are lost.

3. **Double-refund prevention** — Because the record is zeroed after the first
   successful transfer, a second call for the same contributor is a no-op
   (returns 0, emits no transfer).

4. **Zero-amount skip** — Contributors with a zero balance are skipped without
   a cross-contract call, saving gas and keeping the event log clean.

5. **Token address immutability** — The token client is always constructed from
   the address stored at initialisation.  A caller cannot substitute a
   different token contract.

6. **No overflow** — `amount` is an `i128` read directly from storage.  It was
   validated at contribution time (checked_add) so it cannot exceed the total
   tokens held by the contract.

# `refund_single` — Pull-Based Token Refund

## Overview

`refund_single` is the preferred refund mechanism for the crowdfund contract.
It replaces the deprecated batch `refund()` function with a pull-based model
where each contributor independently claims their own refund.

## Why pull-based?

The old `refund()` iterated over every contributor in a single transaction.
On a campaign with many contributors this is unsafe:

- **Unbounded gas**: iteration cost grows linearly with contributor count.
- **Denial of service**: a single bad actor could bloat the contributors list
  to make the batch refund prohibitively expensive.
- **Poor composability**: scripts and automation cannot easily retry partial
  failures.

`refund_single` processes exactly one contributor per call, so gas costs are
constant and predictable regardless of campaign size.
